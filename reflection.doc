Reflection
To enhance the reading experience, I choose to not use the embed grid design. I don't want my audience got distracted by web page design, so I isolate the article and blog design itself. On another hand, to highlight my blog theme, I chose the best design style which matches my topic. The main layout design is the pen and paper and I use a lot of Japanese culture symbols to hint what I would be going to talk in my posts.

I learned a lot during this semester's project. There are a lot of new concepts like narrative bound, intertextuality, and modes of persuasion, which are pretty helpful for me to write some narrative stuff. To write this blog, I use something which I learned from studying intertextuality. I used different lore to weave the narrative bound and used intertextuality to connect them with each other. At last, the main concept which I want to tell my reader is that knowing further knowledge would bring people further viewpoints even they read the same media.

And also, for my intended audience, I prefer to provide a book list for them when they coming for seeking further level knowledge. I would also provide the native-language official website for the reader who met the requirement that could gather information form native language articles directly.
